<p>Software Freedom Conservancy is an essential organization to free and
open source software. We are the home of over
<a href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/current/">30 projects</a> like 
Git,
Inkscape, Samba, Wine, Selenium, the Linux Compliance project, PyPy and
Sugar Labs just to name a few. Conservancy is a "fiscal sponsor plus",
providing everything that our projects need in a nonprofit. We help our
projects defend their trademarks, manage their assets, handle donations,
improve their community management, manage risk and assist them with all
legal needs they may have. While we do receive a portion of the revenue
donated to our projects, we keep that number low enough that it doesn't
even pay for a single staff member. Help us show that you care about
community-focused free software and help us be able to continue our
charitable work. Donating to Conservancy is a great non-technical way to
contribute to the cause.</p>

<p>For the first time, we're launching a Supporter program. For an 
annual
donation of $120, you can download an official Supporter card and
receive a Conservancy t-shirt[1]. If this is out of reach, please donate
at whatever level you can - it makes a big difference to us to know that
you support us, and a little goes a long way.</p>

<p>In addition to supporting our projects,
<ul>

<li>we share our expertise across communities. We speak at many
conferences, and publish materials to increase understanding about the
organizational, community and legal issues around free and open source
software. We advocate for free an open source software and provide
education around that mission.  We form partnerships across our
communities to work more effectively.  Check out <a

or sign up to join the <a

tax exempt working group</a>.</li>

<li>we seek to solve problems for the public through free and open 
source
software.  We've launched a <a href="http://npoacct.sfconservancy.org/">
nonprofits accounting project</a> to help all
nonprofits (in free software and in other fields) avoid paying millions
of dollars in licensing fees for subpar accounting software.</li>

<li>as part of Conservancy's partnership in the program, we support Karen as
  a co-organizer of the Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program.</li>

<li>we encourage and support our employees to do volunteer work in the
    community.  For example, Bradley and Karen together host an oggcast
    called <cite><a href="http://faif.us">Free as in Freedom</a></cite> which
    discusses important legal and policy issues in open source and free
    software.</li></ul>

<p>As an organization, we try to do do everything transparently; even 
our
<a

internal policies</a> are published and available for scrutiny.</p>

<p>Please join our Supporter program and spread software freedom!</p>
