<h1>Directors</h1>

<p>Like many non-profits, Conservancy is directed by a
self-perpetuating <a href="/about/team/board/">Board of Directors</a>, who
appoint <a href="/about/team/officers/">Officers</a> to carry out the
day-to-day operations of the organization.  The Directorship of the
Conservancy includes both talented non-profit managers and experienced
FLOSS project leaders who can both guide the administrative operations of
the organization as well as mentor member project leaders as needed.  Our
Directors constantly search for additional directors who can contribute a
variety of expertise and perspective related to the Conservancy's
mission.</p>

<p>Currently, the directors of Conservancy are:</p>
