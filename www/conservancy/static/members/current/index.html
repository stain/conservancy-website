<p>Boost emphasizes libraries that work well with the C++ Standard
  Library.  Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable
  across a broad spectrum of applications.  The Boost license encourages
  both commercial and non-commercial use.</p>

<p>Boost aims to establish &ldquo;existing practice&rdquo; and provide
reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for
eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries are already included in the
C++ Standards Committee's Library Technical Report (TR1) as a step toward
becoming part of a future C++ Standard. More Boost libraries are proposed
for the upcoming TR2.</p>

<h2><a href="http://buildbot.net/">Buildbot</a></h2>

<h2><a href="http://www.busybox.net">BusyBox</a></h2>

<p>BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the
utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The
utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their
full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any
small or embedded system.</p>

<p>BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited
resources in mind. It is also extremely modular so you can easily
include or exclude commands (or features) at compile time. This makes
it easy to customize your embedded systems. To create a working
system, just add some device nodes in /dev, a few configuration files
in /etc, and a Linux kernel.</p>


<h2><a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a></h2>

<p>Darcs is a distributed revision control system written in Haskell. In
Darcs, every copy of your source code is a full repository, which allows for
full operation in a disconnected environment, and also allows anyone with
read access to a Darcs repository to easily create their own branch and
modify it with the full power of Darcs' revision control. Darcs is based on
an underlying theory of patches, which allows for safe reordering and
merging of patches even in complex scenarios. For all its power, Darcs
remains a very easy to use tool for every day use because it follows the
principle of keeping simple things simple.  Darcs is free software
licensed under the GNU GPL.</p>

<h2><a href="http://evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen</a></h2>

<p>The Evergreen Project develops an open source ILS (integrated library
system) used by hundreds of libraries across the world. The software, also
called Evergreen, is used by libraries to provide their public catalog
interface as well as to manage back-of-house operations such as
circulation (checkouts and checkins), acquisition and cataloging of
library materials, and sharing resources among groups of libraries and
consortia on the same Evergreen system.  Evergreen is designed to be
scalable and supports library operations ranging from a small high school
to large state-wide consortia.  Evergreen is released under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPLv2</a>-or-later.</p>

open-standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format. Inkscape's
main goal is to create a powerful and convenient drawing tool fully
compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards.</p>

<p>In contrast to raster (bitmap) graphics editors such as Photoshop or
Gimp, Inkscape stores its graphics in a vector format. Vector graphics
is a resolution-independent description of the actual shapes and
objects that you see in the image. This description is then used to
determine how to plot each line and curve at any resolution or zoom
level.</p>
