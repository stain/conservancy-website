<h1>Conservancy's Sponsors &amp; Supporters</h1>

<p>Conservancy relies on donations from the general public to support its
work, and asks everyone <a href="/donate">to donate generously</a>.

<h2>Sponsors</h2>

<p>The sponsors whose logos are listed below (in alphabetical order) have donated
substantially in the past twelve months to support the ongoing work of
Conservancy.  These sponsors support our work through financial
contributions  and have asked for public acknowledgment of their
contributions.  Conservancy graciously thanks these sponsors for their
support, but doesn't necessarily endorse nor promote any specific activity of
any of its sponsors.</p>

<!-- logos should be 250x250 maximum. -->
